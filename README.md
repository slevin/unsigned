#Exploration of the Unsigned Integer
The unsigned integer types in C are an implementation detail masquerading as abstraction.

#Languages
* obj c
* c
* c++ (probably all the same)
* rust
* d language (same as c)
* go?
* clojure?
* java
* c#
* f#
* haskel? (probably wouldn't convert)
* non manifest type languages don't have the problem
* erlang
* elixir
* ada
